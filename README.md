# Android-Java-Projects
This repository are some of my works of apps I have created using the Java Programming Language. 

Have any pointers or anything I could improve on, please send me a message! I love constructive criticism on the logic in my code. This will be one of my two Android Project Repositories. The other is in Kotlin! 
I will be writing more apps in the years to come that will be in this repository, hope my code helps people!
